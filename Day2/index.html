  <p><strong>Everyone loves Wrocław (vrots-wahf) and it’s easy to see why. Though in some ways it’s a more manageable version of Kraków, with all the cultural attributes and entertainment of that popular destination, the capital of Lower Silesia also has an appealing character all its own.</strong></p>  
  
  <h2>Having absorbed Bohemian, Austrian and Prussian influences, the city has a unique architectural and cultural make-up, symbolised by its magnificent market square (Rynek). Wrocław’s location on the Odra River, with its 12 islands, 130 bridges and riverside parks, is idyllic, and the beautifully preserved Cathedral Island is a treat for lovers of Gothic architecture. But Wrocław is not just a pretty face. It is Poland’s fourth-largest city and the major industrial, commercial and educational centre for the region; virtually everything in southwestern Poland starts, finishes or is taking place in Wrocław. At the same time it’s a lively cultural centre, with several theatres, major festivals, rampant nightlife and a large student community <a href="http://www.tourmag.com/Pologne-Wroclaw-la-ville-aux-112-ponts-capitale-europeenne-de-la-culture_a78199.html" target = "blank"> Wroclaw </a> </h2>
